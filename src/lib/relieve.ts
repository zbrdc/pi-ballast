 * 1. **`relieve` never accepts a PID.** It accepts ids that `buildPlan` minted,
 *    and re-derives the target from a freshly read process table. A caller —
 *    the panel, `bb ballast`, or an agent — cannot name a process Ballast did
 *    not already decide was fair game.
 * 2. **Authorization is re-checked at the moment of the kill, not when the
 *    plan was built.** A plan is a snapshot; by the time it is acted on the
 *    PID may have been recycled onto something precious. Every candidate is
 *    re-validated against the live table and the protected list immediately
 *    before a signal is sent, and a command line that no longer matches is a
 *    refusal rather than a kill.
