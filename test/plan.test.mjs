/**
 * What gets graded `safe`.
 *
 * `safe` is the tier the guard is allowed to act on without asking, so the
 * question each of these pins is the one that decides it: is anything still
 * waiting on this process? Nothing here may depend on a port number, a
 * directory, or any other local convention — an earlier version graded dev
 * servers by port against a shipped default list, which worked on exactly one
 * machine.
